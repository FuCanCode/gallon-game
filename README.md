# Gallon Game

This is a practice project inspired by a point-and-click game (and some how by the gallon puzzle in Die Hard 3). The goal is to fill the containers according to the numbers on the outsides.

It is just made of static HTML, CSS and JavaScript and features a pipleline for deployment on Azure. The "final" version is in the beta branch. I do not clean up the code or do a merge to main for historical reasons ;).

You can see it in action and play <a href="https://nice-meadow-027dab703.3.azurestaticapps.net" target="_blank">here</a>.
